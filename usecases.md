# Something with Machine Learning



# Something with GDAL

(workflow to be adjusted!)
Data: some tif files
Workflow: reproject add overview

eg. https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/gdal?

# Something with DEM

Data: NLS pointcloud 

Worfkflow: pointcloud to raster per tile, then vrt

parallelization as eg array job

# Something with SNAP

Data: Sentinel-1

workflow: calibration, subsetting, terrain correction

parallelization as array job

eg. https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/snap


# Something with R

# Something with Matlab

maybe just a note that it is fairly easy and no need to deal with job scripts etc?

# Something with database

own computer vs Pouta

eg: https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing/tree/master/pouta/postgis
